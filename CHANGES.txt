1.2.0 (Jul XX, 2020)
 - Updated `@splitsoftware/splitio` dependency to version 10.13.0, that uses streaming synchronization by default. Streaming can be disabled via the `streamingEnabled` config param.
  If disabled or in the event of an issue, the SDK will fallback to the known polling mechanism to provide a seamless experience.
 - Added missing status properties of Split clients (`isReadyFromCache`, `hasTimedout`, and `isDestroyed`) into SplitContext. They are passed down as props to the child of both SplitFactory,
 SplitClient and SplitTreatments components.
 - Added gracefull shut down of Split SDK, when SplitFactory component is unmounted.
 - Bugfixing - Incorrect status properties in SplitContext when using SplitClient component.

1.1.0 (March 11, 2020)
 - Exported `SplitContext` to access Split readiness state when using React hooks.
 - Bugfixing - issue with SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT events.
