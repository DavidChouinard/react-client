1.2.0 (Jun XX, 2020)
 - Added support for the new Split streaming architecture. When enabled, the SDK will not poll for updates but instead receive notifications every time there's a change in your environments,
  allowing to process those much quicker. If disabled (default) or in the event of an issue, the SDK will fallback to the known polling mechanism to provide a seamless experience.
 - Added `isReadyFromCache` prop @TODO.
 - Bugfixing - @TODO.

1.1.0 (March 11, 2020)
 - Exported `SplitContext` to access Split readiness state when using React hooks.
 - Bugfixing - issue with SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT events.

1.0.0 (January 24, 2020)
 - Initial public release!
